There are two steps to completing an installation:

- Setting up the repository
- Installing the package

For each step, you must be logged in as superuser.

```shell
# To log in as a superuser:
sudo su -
```

Before setting up the repository, you need to register with EDB. To receive credentials for the EDB repository, visit: [Repository Access Request](https://www.enterprisedb.com/repository-access-request).

## Setting up the repository

```shell
# Install the repository configuration and enter your EDB repository
# credentials when prompted
zypper addrepo https://zypp.enterprisedb.com/suse/edb-sles.repo

# Install SUSEConnect to register the host with SUSE, allowing access to SUSE repositories
zypper install SUSEConnect

# Register the host with SUSE, allowing access to SUSE repositories
# You can skip this step if already registered
# Replace 'REGISTRATION_CODE' and 'EMAIL' with your SUSE registration information
SUSEConnect -r 'REGISTRATION_CODE' -e 'EMAIL'

# Activate the required SUSE modules on SUSE 12 
SUSEConnect -p PackageHub/12.5/x86_64
SUSEConnect -p sle-sdk/12.5/x86_64

# Refresh the metadata
zypper refresh

# Install OpenJDK (version 1.8) for Java based components
zypper -n install java-1_8_0-openjdk
```

## Installing the package

```shell
zypper -n install edb-as14-edbplus
```
