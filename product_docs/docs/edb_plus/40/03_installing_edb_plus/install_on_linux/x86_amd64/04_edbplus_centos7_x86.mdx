You can use an RPM package to install EDB\*Plus on a CentOS host.

1. To install the repository configuration file, assume superuser privileges, and invoke the following command:
    ```text
    yum -y install https://yum.enterprisedb.com/edbrepos/edb-repo-latest.noarch.rpm
    ```
    
2. Replace the `USERNAME:PASSWORD` variable in the following command with the username and password of a registered EDB user:
    ```text
    sed -i "s@<username>:<password>@USERNAME:PASSWORD@" /etc/yum.repos.d/edb.repo
    ```

1. Before installing EDB\*Plus, install the `epel-release` package:
    ```text
    yum -y install https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/epel-release-latest-7.noarch.rpm
    ```
    
    The repository configuration file is named `edb.repo`. The file resides in `/etc/yum.repos.d`. 
    
1. After saving your changes to the configuration file, install EDB\*Plus:
    ```text
    yum -y install edb-asxx-edbplus
    ```
    
    Where, `xx` is the Advanced Server version.

When you install an RPM package that is signed by a source that is not recognized by your system, `yum` may ask for your permission to import the key to your local server. If prompted, and you are satisfied that the packages come from a trustworthy source, enter `y`, and press `Return` to continue.

During the installation, `yum` may encounter a dependency that it cannot resolve. If it does, it will provide a list of the required dependencies that you must manually resolve.
