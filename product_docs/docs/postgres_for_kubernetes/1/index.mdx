Key features available include:
- Kubernetes API integration for high availability
- Self-healing through failover and automated recreation of replicas
- Capacity management with scale up/down capabilities
- Planned switchovers for scheduled maintenance
- Read-only and read-write Kubernetes services definitions
- Rolling updates for Postgres minor versions and operator upgrades
- Continuous backup and point-in-time recovery
- Connection Pooling with PgBouncer
- Integrated metrics exporter out of the box
- PostgreSQL replication across multiple Kubernetes clusters
- Red Hat certified operator for OpenShift

The operator has been renamed from Cloud Native PostgreSQL. Existing users of Cloud Native PostgreSQL will not experience any change, as the underlying components and resources have not changed.
