This is new major release of HARP that constitutes of complete rewrite of the
product.

| Type | Description |
| ---- |------------ |
| Engine | Complete rewrite of system in golang to optimize all operations |
| Engine | Cluster state can now be bootstrapped or revised via YAML |
| Feature | Configuration now in YAML, configuration file changed from `harp.ini` to `config.yml` |
| Feature | HARP Proxy deprecates need for HAProxy in supported architecture.<p>The use of HARP Router to translate DCS contents into appropriate online or offline states for HTTP-based URI requests meant a load balancer or HAProxy was necessary to determine the lead master. HARP Proxy now does this automatically without periodic iterative status checks. </p> |
| Feature | Utilizes DCS key subscription to respond directly to state changes.<p> With relevant cluster state changes, the cluster responds immediately, resulting in improved failover and switchover times. </p> |
| Feature | Compatibility with etcd SSL settings.<p> It is now possible to communicate with etcd through SSL encryption.</p> |
| Feature | Zero transaction lag on switchover.<p> Transactions are not routed to the new lead node until all replicated transactions are replayed, thereby reducing the potential for conflicts.</p>
| Feature | Experimental BDR Consensus layer.<p> Using BDR Consensus as the Distributed Consensus Service (DCS) reduces the amount of change needed for implementations.</p>
| Feature | Experimental built-in proxy.<p>Proxy implementation for increased session control.</p> |
