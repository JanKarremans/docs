navTitle: "Debian 9"

To install EDB Postgres Advanced Server on a Debian host, you must have credentials that allow access to the EDB repository. To request credentials for the repository, visit:

<https://www.enterprisedb.com/repository-access-request>

The following steps walk you through using the EDB apt repository to install a debian package. When using the commands, replace the `username` and `password` with the credentials provided by EDB.

-   Assume superuser privileges:

    ```text
    sudo su â€“
    ```

-   Configure the EDB repository and replace the `username` and `password` placeholders in the following command:

    ```text
    sh -c 'echo "deb https://USERNAME:PASSWORD@apt.enterprisedb.com/$(lsb_release -cs)-edb/ $(lsb_release -cs) main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/edb-$(lsb_release -cs).list'
    ```

-   Add support to your system for secure APT repositories:

    ```text
    apt-get -y install apt-transport-https
    ```

-   Add the EDB signing key:

    ```text
    wget -q -O - https://apt.enterprisedb.com/edb-deb.gpg.key  | sudo apt-key add -
    ```

-   Update the repository metadata:

    ```text
    apt-get update
    ```

-   Install the package:

    ```text
    apt-get -y install edb-as14-server
    ```

!!! Note
    Some EDB Postgres Advanced Server supporting components require a Java installation. Before using a native package to add Migration Toolkit or EDB\*Plus to your system, make sure that Java version 8 is installed on your EDB Postgres Advanced Server host.

## Initial configuration
This section steps you through connecting to your cluster, and creating the user password. See [Managing an EDB Postgres Advanced Server installation](/epas/latest/epas_inst_linux/managing_an_advanced_server_installation), for more information including how to use pgAdmin4 to connect to your cluster using its graphical interface instead of the command line option given below.

```shell
# To work in your cluster, login as `enterprisedb` user:
su - enterprisedb
# Connect to the database server using psql command line client:
psql edb
# Assign a password to the database superuser `enterprisedb`:
ALTER ROLE enterprisedb IDENTIFIED BY password;
# Creating a database (named hr):
CREATE DATABASE hr;
# Connect to the new database and create a table (named dept):
\c hr
CREATE TABLE public.dept (deptno numeric(2) NOT NULL CONSTRAINT dept_pk PRIMARY KEY, 
dname varchar(14) CONSTRAINT dept_dname_uq UNIQUE, loc varchar(13));
# Add data to the table:
INSERT INTO dept VALUES (10,'ACCOUNTING','NEW YORK');
INSERT into dept VALUES (20,'RESEARCH','DALLAS');
# You can use simple SQL commands to query the database and retrieve 
# information about the data you have added to the table. 
SELECT * FROM dept;
```
