You can use native package to install EDB Postgres Advanced Server on a RHEL 8 or OL 8 host.

## Setting up the repository

-   To install the repository configuration file, assume superuser privileges and invoke one of the following platform specific commands:

    ```text
    dnf -y install https://yum.enterprisedb.com/edbrepos/edb-repo-latest.noarch.rpm
    ```

-   Replace the `USERNAME:PASSWORD` variable in the following command with the username and password of a registered EDB user:

    ```text
    sed -i "s@<username>:<password>@USERNAME:PASSWORD@" /etc/yum.repos.d/edb.repo
    ```

-   Before installing EDB Postgres Advanced Server, you must install the `epel-release` package:

    ```text
    # dnf -y install https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/epel-release-latest-8.noarch.rpm

    # dnf makecache
    ```

-   Enable the `codeready-builder-for-rhel-8-*-rpms` repository to satisfy package dependencies:

    ```text
    ARCH=$( /bin/arch )

    subscription-manager repos --enable "codeready-builder-for-rhel-8-${ARCH}-rpms"
    ```

-   Disable the built-in PostgreSQL module:

    ```text
    dnf -qy module disable postgresql
    ```

The repository configuration file is named `edb.repo`. The file resides in `/etc/yum.repos.d.` 

You must download and install the repository key. Provide the registered `username` and `password` with the `curl` command to download the repository key using the following command:

```text
curl -o /etc/pki/rpm-gpg/ENTERPRISEDB-GPG-KEY https://<username>:<password>@yum.enterprisedb.com/ENTERPRISEDB-GPG-KEY
```

Use the following command to install the key:

```text
rpm --import /etc/pki/rpm-gpg/ENTERPRISEDB-GPG-KEY
```

## Install the package

You can use `dnf install` command to install EDB Postgres Advanced Server. For example, to install the server and its core components, use the command:

```text
dnf -y install edb-as14-server
```
To install an individual component:

```shell
dnf install package_name
```

Where `package_name` can be any of the available package from the [available package list](/epas/latest/epas_inst_linux/install_details/rpm_packages/).

When you install an RPM package that is signed by a source that is not recognized by your system, `yum` may ask for your permission to import the key to your local server. If prompted, and you are satisfied that the packages come from a trustworthy source, enter a `y`, and press `Return` to continue.

!!! Note
    During the installation, `dnf` may encounter a dependency that it cannot resolve. If it does, it provides a list of the required dependencies that you must manually resolve.

## Initial configuration
This section steps you through getting started with your cluster including logging in, ensuring the installation and initial configuration was successful, connecting to your cluster, and creating the user password. See [Managing an EDB Postgres Advanced Server installation](/epas/latest/epas_inst_linux/managing_an_advanced_server_installation), for more information including how to use pgAdmin4 to connect to your cluster using its graphical interface instead of the command line option given below.

```shell
# Initialize the database cluster:
PGSETUP_INITDB_OPTIONS="-E UTF-8" /usr/edb/as14/bin/edb-as-14-setup initdb
   
# Start the database cluster:
systemctl start edb-as-14
# To work in your cluster, login as `enterprisedb` user:
su - enterprisedb
# Connect to the database server using psql command line client:
psql edb
# Assign a password to the database superuser `enterprisedb`:
ALTER ROLE enterprisedb IDENTIFIED BY password;
# Creating a database (named hr):
CREATE DATABASE hr;
# Connect to the new database and create a table (named dept):
\c hr
CREATE TABLE public.dept (deptno numeric(2) NOT NULL CONSTRAINT dept_pk PRIMARY KEY, 
dname varchar(14) CONSTRAINT dept_dname_uq UNIQUE, loc varchar(13));
# Add data to the table:
INSERT INTO dept VALUES (10,'ACCOUNTING','NEW YORK');
INSERT into dept VALUES (20,'RESEARCH','DALLAS');
# You can use simple SQL commands to query the database and retrieve 
# information about the data you have added to the table. 
SELECT * FROM dept;
```
