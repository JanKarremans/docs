There are two steps to completing an installation:

- Setting up the repository
- Installing the package

For each step, you must be logged in as superuser.

```shell
# To log in as a superuser:
sudo su -
```

Before setting up the repository, you need to register with EDB. To receive credentials for the EDB repository, visit: [Repository Access Request](https://www.enterprisedb.com/repository-access-request).

## Setting up the repository

```shell
# Install the repository configuration and enter your EDB repository
# credentials when prompted
zypper addrepo https://zypp.enterprisedb.com/suse/edb-sles.repo

# Install SUSEConnect to register the host with SUSE, allowing access to SUSE repositories
zypper install SUSEConnect

# Register the host with SUSE, allowing access to SUSE repositories
# You can skip this step if already registered
# Replace 'REGISTRATION_CODE' and 'EMAIL' with your SUSE registration information
SUSEConnect -r 'REGISTRATION_CODE' -e 'EMAIL'

# Activate the required SUSE modules on SUSE 12 
SUSEConnect -p PackageHub/12.5/x86_64
SUSEConnect -p sle-sdk/12.5/x86_64

# Refresh the metadata
zypper refresh
```

## Installing the package

```shell
zypper -n install edb-as14-server
```

To install an individual component:

```shell
zypper install package_name
```

Where `package_name` can be any of the available package from the [available package list](/epas/latest/epas_inst_linux/install_details/rpm_packages/).

## Initial configuration
This section steps you through getting started with your cluster including logging in, ensuring the installation and initial configuration was successful, connecting to your cluster, and creating the user password. See [Managing an EDB Postgres Advanced Server installation](/epas/latest/epas_inst_linux/managing_an_advanced_server_installation), for more information including how to use pgAdmin4 to connect to your cluster using its graphical interface instead of the command line option given below.

```shell
# Initialize the database cluster:
PGSETUP_INITDB_OPTIONS="-E UTF-8" /usr/edb/as14/bin/edb-as-14-setup initdb
   
# Start the database cluster:
systemctl start edb-as-14
# To work in your cluster, login as `enterprisedb` user:
su - enterprisedb
# Connect to the database server using psql command line client:
psql edb
# Assign a password to the database superuser `enterprisedb`:
ALTER ROLE enterprisedb IDENTIFIED BY password;
# Creating a database (named hr):
CREATE DATABASE hr;
# Connect to the new database and create a table (named dept):
\c hr
CREATE TABLE public.dept (deptno numeric(2) NOT NULL CONSTRAINT dept_pk PRIMARY KEY, 
dname varchar(14) CONSTRAINT dept_dname_uq UNIQUE, loc varchar(13));
# Add data to the table:
INSERT INTO dept VALUES (10,'ACCOUNTING','NEW YORK');
INSERT into dept VALUES (20,'RESEARCH','DALLAS');
# You can use simple SQL commands to query the database and retrieve 
# information about the data you have added to the table. 
SELECT * FROM dept;
```
