Before connecting to your cloud, you must set permissions to allow BigAnimal to perform maintenance operations in your cloud.

* **If connecting to Azure**:
    Register an application with Azure AD and create a service principal to delegate Identity and Access Management functions to Azure Active Directory (AD).

* **If connecting to AWS**:
    Create a role EDBOperations and set its *policy/trust* and *policy/policy* boundaries to * with EDB's AWS account. This allows EDB's IAM users to assume the EDBOperations role in your AWS account.

BigAnimal CLI commands used in the procedures for connecting your cloud to BigAnimal automatically sets these permissions for you. For more information, see EDB cloud utilites in GitHub for [Azure](https://github.com/EnterpriseDB/cloud-utilities/tree/main/azure) and [AWS](https://github.com/EnterpriseDB/cloud-utilities/tree/main/aws).

## Connect your cloud to BigAnimal

How you connect your cloud to BigAnimal depends on if you purchased BigAnimal from the Azure Marketplace or if you purchased it directly from EDB and are connecting your own cloud account.
