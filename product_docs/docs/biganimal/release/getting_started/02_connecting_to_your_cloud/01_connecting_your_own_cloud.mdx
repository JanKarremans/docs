You can connect BigAnimal to your own Azure subscription or AWS account. To connect to your own cloud account, EDB provides a command that automatically sets up your account.

**Prerequisites**:

Before connecting to your cloud account, ensure that:

 - **If connecting to an AWS account:** 

   You are assigned the following AWS managed policies (or an equivalent custom policy granting full access to resources):

    - arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/IAMFullAccess

    - arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/ServiceQuotasFullAccess
    
 - **If connecting to an Azure subscription:** 
 
   You are assigned either of the following roles in Azure AD:

    - Global Administrator

    - Privileged Role Administrator

 - In [Azure Cloud Shell](https://shell.azure.com/) or [AWS Cloud Shell](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudshell), your environment is running: 

      - bash shell version 4.0 or above. 

      - [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/) JSON parser.
      - BigAnimal CLI version 1.4 or later. For detailed steps, see [Installing the CLI](../../reference/cli/#installing-the-cli).

 - The BigAnimal login user running the CLI is assigned either the owner or the contributor role.
   
Perform the following steps:

1. Open the [Azure Cloud Shell](https://shell.azure.com/) or the [AWS Cloud Shell](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudshell) in your browser. 

1. Log in to BigAnimal as a user with either the owner or the contributor role.
   
   ```
   biganimal create-credential --name <UserLogin> --address portal.biganimal.com --port 443
   ```

1. Run the `setup-csp` command to set up your cloud provider. The synatx is:
   
    ```
    setup-csp --provider 
          {--account-id | --subscription-id}
          --region
          [--instance-type --high-availability --networking | --skip-preflight]
          [--run]
    ```
   
   Here is an example of setting up an AWS account:

    ```
   biganimal setup-csp --provider aws --account-id 123456789102  --region us-east-1 --instance-type aws:r5.large --high-availability --networking private --run
   ```

   Here is an example if setting up an Azure account:
    ```
   biganimal setup-csp --provider azure --subscription-id abc12345-1234-1234-abcd-12345678901 --region eastus --instance-type azure:Standard_E4s_v3 --high-availability --networking private --run
   ```
  
   For more information on the command arguments, run the following command:

   ```
   biganimal setup-csp --help
   ```        
   
   Alternatively, you can enable the CLI interactive mode to have the CLI guide you through the process:
   ```
   biganimal config set interactive_mode on
   biganimal setup-csp
   ```
  
1. The command checks for cloud account readiness and displays the results. You need to manually increase resource limits or perform required configurations in your cloud, if either of the following readiness checks are not met: 
    * **If connecting to Azure**:
       - Are the necessary Azure resource providers registered for your subscription?
       - Is there a restriction on SKUs for the standard Esv3 family and standard D2_v4 VM size?
       - Is the limit on the number of vCPU and public IP addresses in your region sufficient for your clusters?
    * **If connecting to AWS**:
       - Is the AWS CLI configured to access your AWS account?
       - Is the limit on the number of vCPUs and Network Load Balancers (NLBs) in your region sufficient for your clusters?
    
    !!! Important
    You need to configure your cloud, if any of the readiness checks are not met, see [Configure your Azure subscription](/biganimal/release/getting_started/preparing_cloud_account/01_preparing_azure#configure-your-azure-subscription) or [Configure your AWS account](/biganimal/release/getting_started/preparing_cloud_account/02_preparing_aws/#configure-your-aws-account).
	
1. If the cloud readiness checks pass, your cloud account is successfully set up. Connect your cloud account to BigAnimal with following command. 
   ```
   biganimal connect-csp --provider  <cloud-service-provider> 
   ```

Once your cloud account is successfully connected to BigAnimal, you and other users can log in using your identity provider credentials.
